# On The Fly Scientific Calculator

The initial idea to build a calculator came from an [exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) proposed in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), but I took the project much further than what was proposed.

The calculator was built to work and display well both on computers and mobile devices.

Some characteristics of this calculator are:
- The calculator parses (with a built-in simple LL(1) parser) the expressions entered and calculates its values on the fly. 
- It is programmed to prevent the user to enter ill-formed expressions.
- It stores (in the browser local storage) a history of the last hundred calculations, with the possibility os retrieving its results for use in new calculations. 

**This readme is still a work in progress and will be updated with more details about the parsing process, the calculator capabilities and some user instructions.**
